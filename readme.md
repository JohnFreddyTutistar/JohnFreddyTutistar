<h1 align="center"><b>Hi! I'm John. pleasure to meet you. ðŸ‘‹</b></h1> 

* I was born in the city of Pasto, Colombia on February 3, 1994, I am currently 28 years old, since I was very young I have been very curious about technology and its operation, that is why I studied Systems Engineering, I like front-end development, but Lately I'm very interested in server-side (back-end) programming. Number one fan of learning and the interaction of new technologies.

* Web programmer with more than 3 years of experience in frontend frameworks such as VueJs and Angular and backend development with node and php. Throughout this time I have had the privilege of knowing different programming languages â€‹â€‹with which I have developed some web applications and one or another application for android devices, SCRUM being a support methodology to guarantee their quality. I seek to be part of development teams to enhance my knowledge and contribute greatly to the technology industry.
